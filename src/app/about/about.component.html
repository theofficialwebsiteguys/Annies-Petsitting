        <p class="fs-5">We understand that pets are most comfortable in their own homes. That's why Annie's Petsitting
          provides both occasional visits and overnight care. During visits, we feed, play, and attend to your pet's
          needs, ensuring they feel loved and cared for. For those who need extra attention or suffer from separation
          anxiety, our overnight service offers the reassurance of having a dedicated sitter by their side through the
          night, ensuring they are not alone and maintaining their regular routine.</p>
